## 🚀 Installation

1. **Download** the latest release:  
   👉 [NailBiteMenu.dmg](https://github.com/killian31/NailBiteMenu/releases/latest/download/NailBiteMenu.dmg)

2. **Open** the DMG and **drag** `NailBiteMenu.app` into your **Applications** folder.

3. When launching the first time, macOS will warn that it’s from an *unidentified developer*: go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.

4. After that, NailBiteMenu runs quietly from your **menu bar**.

> 💡 **Tip:** If your menu bar is full, some icons may be hidden behind the chevron (⌃).  
> Use the chevron to reveal NailBiteMenu, or relaunch it from Applications.


## 🧩 Usage

### Controls
Click the menu bar icon to open controls.  
You can:
- **Start / Stop monitoring**
- **Adjust detection threshold**
- **Select model size (speed vs. accuracy)**

The app uses your default camera, taking 5 pictures per second. This is enough to detect nail-biting and reduces CPU load dramatically.

### Threshold
The threshold controls how sensitive the detection is:
| Threshold | Behavior |
|------------|-----------|
| **Low (e.g. 0.45)** | More sensitive, may trigger false positives |
| **Medium (≈ 0.6)** | Balanced (recommended) |
| **High (e.g. 0.9)** | Less sensitive, only strong detections trigger alerts |

Tweak it depending on lighting conditions and how close you sit to the camera.

### Model Size
The app includes several model variants corresponding to different input image size:

| Model | Description | Speed | Accuracy |
|--------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| **224px** | Fastest, lowest power usage | ⚡️⚡️⚡️ | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| **384px** | Better detection accuracy | ⚡️⚡️ | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| **512px** | Highest precision (slower) | ⚡️ | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |

> 💡 Tip: Start with **512px** if running on a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1-M5 chips).
> Intel Macs may heat up when using model > 224px.

## 🔔 Alerts

When nail-biting is detected:
- A popup indicating detection and confidence appears, and is removed either by clicking the button, waiting 3 seconds or hit the Enter key.
- A notification can appear (if enabled in macOS **Notifications & Focus**).


## 🔒 Privacy

- All processing happens **on-device** using your Mac’s camera feed.
- No frames, images, or metrics leave your computer.
- The app does **not** connect to the internet.


## 🧰 Requirements

- macOS **15.6 Sequoia** or later  
- Camera access permission (requested once on first run)
